    "2. Import Altair and pandas.\n",
    "3. Create a plot of the ratings of the product. Study the distribution of the five categories.\n",
    "4. Take a random sample of the reviews by selecting 1500 reviews with rating 1, 500-500-500 reviews with ratings 2, 3, 4, and 1500 reviews with rating 5. This way you get a smaller balanced corpus, on which you will work with in Milestones 2-4.\n",
    "   - It is recommended to use **imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler** from the **imbalanced-learn** package, which should be first installed, then imported.\n",
    "If you want to get identical results to the reference solution, use 42 as a random state.\n",
    "5. Take a random sample of the reviews by selecting 100,000 reviews. This way you get a bigger representative corpus, on which you will work in Milestones 4 and 5.\n",
    "   - It is recommended to use **numpy.random.randint**.\n",
    "   - If you want to get identical results to the reference solution, use 42 as a random state.\n",
    "6. Export your corpora to two separate .csv files. Both of your tables should contain a column for the reviews and a column for the ratings. From now on we call the review text of the JSON key “reviews” and the overall key “ratings.” Name your corpora small_corpus and big_corpus."
